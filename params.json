Since the Keyboard Layout that comes with OSX is pretty much limited and of Traditional type, this is supposed to be a replacement for a much better experience. As easy as 3 steps.\r\n\r\nThis keyboard layout is based on the Nepali Unicode Romanized layout by Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload the [latest version here](https://github.com/downloads/suvash/nepali-romanized-pro/Nepali-Romanized-Pro_1.2.zip), unzip it and run the installer. Sadly enough, you have to restart in order to use the Keyboard Layout.\r\n![Installer](https://github.com/suvash/nepali-romanized-pro/raw/master/images/readme/installer.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAfter installing and restarting your Mac(this is necessary else it won't work.), follow as below.\r\n\r\nOpen \"Language & Text\" in the System Preferences (in Mountain Lion).
